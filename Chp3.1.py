def hello():

    print('Howdy!!!')

# A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times.


def hello(name):
    print('Hello ' + name)


hello('Alice')
hello('Bob')

# Output:
# Hello Alice
# Hello Bob

# Return Values and return Statements

# The return keyword
# The value or expression that the function should return

# The None Value

# In Python there is a value called None, which represents the absence of a .
# None is the only value of the NoneType data type.
# (Other programming languages might call this value null, nil, or undefined.)
# Just like the Boolean True and False values, None must be typed with a capital N.

# This value-without-a-value can be helpful when you need to store something that wonâ€™t
# be confused for a real value in a variable.

# all function calls need to evaluate to a return value, print() returns None

spam = print('Hello!')
# Hello!

None == spam
# True

# Python adds return None to the end of any function definition with no return statement.

# The two strings appear on separate lines because the print() function automatically adds
# a newline character to the end of the string it is passed. However, you can set the end
# keyword argument to change this to a different string.

print('Hello', end='')
print('World')

# Output: HelloWorld

print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice')
# Output: cats dogs mice

# could replace the default separating string by passing the sep keyword argument

print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep=',')
# Output: cats,dogs,mice


# Local and Global Scope
