# Introduction to Python

# going through the basics taught in Chapter 1

2 + 2
# output should be 4

# out put will be 2

2 ** 3      # 8 - exponent
22 % 8      # 6 - modulus/remainder
22 // 8     # 2 - Integer Division/Floored quotient
22 / 8      # 2.75 - Division
3 * 5       # 15 - Multiplication
5 - 2       # 3 - subtraction
2 + 2       # 4 - Addition


# Python follows Order of Operations (precedence)

# # this will result in an error because 5 has not been added to anything

# 42 + 5 + * 2 
# # This will result in an error because two operations are given in a row
